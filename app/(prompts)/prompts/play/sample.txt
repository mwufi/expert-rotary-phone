Generate a complete, optimized webpage by extrapolating from a single UI component or set of components. Use the provided component(s) as a foundation to create a cohesive, fully functional, and efficient page. Follow these steps:

1. Start with the provided component example(s):
   ```html
   {{element}}
   ```
   ```css
   {{styles}}
   ```

2. Analyze the component's style and structure, including colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design language.

3. Clean up and optimize the original styles and element:
   - Remove any redundant or unused CSS
   - Consolidate similar styles
   - Ensure proper use of CSS specificity
   - Optimize the HTML structure for semantic meaning and accessibility
   - Consider using CSS custom properties (variables) for recurring values

4. Create a full HTML structure for a webpage, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

5. In the `<head>`, add a `<style>` tag with the optimized styles and extend them to create a consistent theme for the entire page.

6. In the `<body>`, generate a complete page structure based on the component's purpose:
   - If it's a button: Create a landing page with a hero section, feature list, and call-to-action using the button.
   - If it's a card: Design a grid layout showcasing multiple instances of the card with varied content.
   - If it's a form input: Develop a full contact or signup form using the input style as a base.
   - For other components: Infer an appropriate page type and structure that highlights the component's use.

7. Extrapolate additional UI elements needed for the page (e.g., navigation, footer, headings) based on the optimized component's style.

8. Implement responsive design principles to ensure the page looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

9. Further optimize the full page:
   - Use CSS methodologies like BEM or utility-first CSS for scalability
   - Implement performance best practices (e.g., proper use of heading hierarchy, lazy loading for images)
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions across HTML classes and CSS selectors

10. Add comments in the HTML and CSS to explain the optimization process and how the original component's style was extrapolated to create the full page design.

Example output structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Optimized UI Design</title>
    <style>
        /* Optimized and extended styles */
        :root {
            /* CSS custom properties for consistent theming */
        }

        /* Base styles */
        /* Component-specific styles */
        /* Layout styles */
        /* Utility classes */
        /* Responsive adjustments */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <header class="header">
        <!-- Optimized navigation based on component style -->
    </header>
    <main class="main-content">
        <!-- Optimized main content structure -->
        <!-- Original component used in context with optimized structure -->
        <!-- Additional extrapolated and optimized elements -->
    </main>
    <footer class="footer">
        <!-- Optimized footer design based on component style -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
